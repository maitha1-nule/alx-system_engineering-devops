Welcome again to another project 0x09. Web infrastructure design

In this project i was tasked to come up with diagrams showing how the internet works or better say what happens when a user wants to get information from a certain website.

Firstly I learned about how domain name sytems are, what a server and web server i, what load balancing means and how its useful in websites, also learned about the different methods of dealing with it. 

DNS mostly refered as domain name system is a technology that is useful in simple terms convert text based address to ip address that computers understand since computers mainly understand numbers than texts. There are many types of dns records but most importantly one should know about one called an A record becaouse it is the one that is mostly used. An adress record uses maps domain names to the ip address of the computer hosting the domain eg www.google.com === just an example 127.56.143.8
There are more record types, so for more information just look it up in your favorite Engine.

A server is a computer while a web server handles HTTP requests meaning once a HTTP requst is received it returns the responce with  a HTML page
. One should remember that a web server does not provide any functionality other than providing an environment in which side server programs can execute.

An apllication server on the other handles dynamic content generation and processing it, it communicates with a database to retrieve or update data as necessary.

A HTTP(hyperper text transfer protocal is a protocal which transfers data between ones browser and the internet he/she is connected to, it is not secure though, a more secure version is one which has an s ie, HTTPS in which the s stands for security meaning that the data is usually transfered in an encrypted manner, hence one should use this than the other one.

Most websites use the LAMP achitecture,ie, linux, Apach as a webserver, My sql as a dbms asn php/python as a programming language used to design and develop websites. If you readupto here make sure you look upto for SPOF and QPS.

This is it for an intrduction, for more information just send me a message and i'll explain more thank you.
