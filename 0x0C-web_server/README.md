Have you ever wondered how the web works, ? I know you normally login to your browser, then send a request for a certain website, things hapen in the background then the broeser sends you back the item you requested for whether a website, pdf etc. so have you ever wondered how all of this happens, like where does the website come from ? 
To answer you're questions, its simple, when a client request for a website, the request is usually send to a server, then then server handles the request and responds back with what the client wants, ie in simple terms it delivers.

Servers are computers that store webpage, sites or apps. When a user wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded feom the server onto the clients machine to be displayed in the users web browser.

The following are what make this possible:
	1. TCP/IP
Transmission protocal and internet protocal are the commmunication protocals that define how data shoukd travel accross the internet.
	2. DNS
Donamin name system is like n address book for websites, when you type : www.google.com the browser checks the dns for the address of the website then returns it to you.
	3. HTTP
This ia an application protocal that defines a language for clients and serves to speak to each other. This is like the language one uses to order goods from a shop whether in english, kiswahili etc
	4. Component files
A website is made up of different parts ie:
		a. code files which are the HTML, Css and js
		b. Assets which are the pdfs, images, music videos etc
:: Okay you've heard that web sites are hosted in servers okay but how ?
Nginx or engine X is a web server that can be used to do all this, its wok is to host static web pages, not that it cant dynamic but mostly static web pages.

I'll stophere for now but more is comming
